Presenters / Credits
=====================

Michael Bayer (@zzzeek) is a New York-based software
engineer with over twenty years experience dealing with database-enabled
applications. After writing many homegrown database abstraction layers in such
languages as C, Java and Perl, and finally after several years of practice
working with a huge multi-server Oracle system for Major League Baseball, he
created SQLAlchemy as the 'ultimate toolset' for generating SQL and dealing
with databases overall. The goal is to contribute towards a world-class
one-of-a-kind toolset for Python, helping to make Python the universally
popular programming platform it deserves to be.

Parts of this handout, as well as the core of the "Slide Presenter" tool, were
written by Jason Kirtland (http://discorporate.us/jek/), an prominent
early contributor to the SQLAlchemy project.

Big thanks to Ben Trofatter for help editing / proofreading this document.
